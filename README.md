Supplementary Materials


This folder contains reproducible R codes of simulation studies and re-analysis of the example data.

In simu-code:

Step 1: Run scenario.R firstly, and produce 3 scenarios RData;

Step 2: create 2 folders named DATA1 and DATA2 under sim-code folder, for saving the produced simulation results in RData.

Step 3: Run sim.rep.R file to produce simulation RData;

Step 4: Use latex-xxx.R file to reproduce the results in the article.
