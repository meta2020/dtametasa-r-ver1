Scenarios. (In scenario-all.R)

We originally considered 
- 18 combinations of {se, sp, t11, t22, t12}
- 3 types of c constant vectors
  * c11 = c22 = 0.5
  * c11 = 1, c22 = 0
  * c11 = 0, c22 = 1
  * c11 denotes c1-square, c22 denotes c2-square


We chose 8 (No. 1,2,3,4, 9,10,15,16) from 18 scenarios 
in 3 types of c constant vectors
to report in our results. 


We considered beta = 0.5, p = 0.7. 
Alpha was calculated by simulation. (By cal-p.R)
